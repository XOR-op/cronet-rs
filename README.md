# cronet-rs
Rust FFI bindings for Chromium network stack(cronet). 

*Note: This project is currently in an experimental phase and is at an early stage of development.
It may be subject to frequent changes, and some features may not be fully implemented.
Currently only macos-aarch64 and linux-x86_64 are tested.*
